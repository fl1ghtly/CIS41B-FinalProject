    What I learned from this project is how to plan and excute on an idea.
    One of the major challenges when starting this project was what
    needed to happen between the server, client, and the database.
    Normally, I would have started immediately and figured things out
    from there, however, since I was working with a partner I knew
    that strategy could not work. Therefore we spent a day or two
    just simply planning things out by writing what each component
    needed to do and what they required in order to do them. Through
    doing this, the project became much easier to work on them my 
    usual labs because the planning took a lot of mental load off
    as it was clear what needed to be done.

    I'm very much the same way. For the past labs I would like to just start
    writing and figure things out along the way instead of planning things out.
    That's not to say I don't put thoughts and plans into the code I am writing, 
    it's just that I don't write those plans down. James was the one to suggest 
    starting with writing function headers first them populate the functions
    later, which gave me a bit of a hard time at the beginning since we didn't
    plan so much such that we wrote down how each function will interact with 
    each other, but as the app was being written the function headers and 
    planning made the process go a lot smoother. Although we didn't have the 
    planning and foresight to make a function header for all the functions that
    we eventually wrote so I still wrote a few full functions along the way, 
    but the planning was still worth it.
