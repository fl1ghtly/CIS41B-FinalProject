    What I learned from this project is how to plan and excute on an idea.
    One of the major challenges when starting this project was what
    needed to happen between the server, client, and the database.
    Normally, I would have started immediately and figured things out
    from there, however, since I was working with a partner I knew
    that strategy could not work. Therefore we spent a day or two
    just simply planning things out by writing what each component
    needed to do and what they required in order to do them. Through
    doing this, the project became much easier to work on them my 
    usual labs because the planning took a lot of mental load off
    as it was clear what needed to be done.
